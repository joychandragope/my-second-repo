    <h1> These Kayakers Fought for Survival After Big Waves Overturned Their Boats </h1>

        One by one, the three kayakers capsized in the cold, angry water. Then they became separated.
        </h3>
    <p>It was meant to be another boys’ trip, the latest in a tradition that stretched back more than two decades. Every other year, the old friends—Jim Farrington, 49, an electrical lineman in Alden, Michigan; Sean Royston, 47, an electrical grid systems manager in Cottage Grove, Wisconsin; and Tolan Annis, 53, the co-owner of a craft distillery in Grand Ledge, Michigan—had kissed their wives goodbye and headed out on an expedition. This time they decided to kayak Lake Superior’s Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, a challenging out-and-back route.</p>
    <h2>Longtime friends separated</h2>
    <p>After Royston tipped, Farrington quickly paddled over to him. He brought his boat parallel to Royston’s and steadied it as Royston scrambled into his cockpit, which was now full of water. He began working the small plastic hand pump but couldn’t stay ahead of the waves.</p>

    <h2>An abandoned plan</h2>
    <P>When Annis capsized, he was about 150 feet from the others—too far away for them to help or communicate. After failing several times to climb back into his kayak, he chose to wait for the others to assist him. But the next time he looked for Royston and Farrington, they were gone.

        Annis resolved to stay with his orange kayak at all costs; it would be easier for rescuers to spot than a lone swimmer dressed in blue and gray. The kayak offered flotation and was packed with the food and dry clothes he’d need if he managed to reach the shore. That was his plan—kick with the kayak around Miners Castle and land at Miners Beach. The problem: 20-knot winds were whipping around the point, making progress in that direction all but impossible. Eventually, Annis abandoned his plan and turned west instead.
        
        While the hours flowed together, Annis kept kicking. “Normally when you have a situation go bad on you it happens fast, and adrenaline carries you through it. But after seven hours—there’s no adrenaline left,” he says. “I had no sense of time, but I’d seen the sun go across the sky. I could start to feel myself becoming hypothermic. I was getting sleepy, my hands were shaking, and I thought, You’ve gotta get out of this water soon or it’s not going to end well.”
        
        About a mile from Sand Point, where their journey began, he saw his chance: a low spot in the cliff with a thick tree root reaching down.</P>
